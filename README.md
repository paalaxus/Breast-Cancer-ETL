# Breast Cancer ETL Pipeline

This repository contains a simple **ETL pipeline** that processes a **breast cancer dataset** using Python and Pandas.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project:
- Extracts data from `breast_cancer.csv`
- Transforms it by selecting only `diagnosis` and `radius_mean` columns
- Loads the transformed data into a new CSV file (`Diagnosis_Data.csv`)

## Files
- `etl_pipeline.py` â†’ The Python script for ETL processing
- `breast_cancer.csv` â†’ The raw dataset
- `Diagnosis_Data.csv` â†’ The cleaned dataset (generated by script)

##  Usage
To run the script, use:

```bash
python etl_pipeline.py
